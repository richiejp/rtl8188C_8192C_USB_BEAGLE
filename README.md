=========================

Realtek drivers for the rtl8188cus and others

The make file is configured to cross compile for the Beagle Bone Black. Just change the KSRC variable to reflect the location of your beagle's kernel source if you want to compile for the Beagle or similar ARM devices.

You will need to install the apropriate version of GCC for your target platform when cross compiling.
